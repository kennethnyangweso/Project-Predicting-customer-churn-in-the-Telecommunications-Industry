Predicting Customer Churn in SyriaTel Telecommunications Company.

A Machine Learning Approach for Proactive Customer Retention

Business Understanding:

Project Overview:

Customer retention is a critical concern for telecommunications companies, as acquiring new customers is often more expensive than retaining existing ones. With increasing competition, understanding why customers leave (churn) and identifying those at risk can significantly improve business strategies. This project aims to build a binary classification model to predict customer churn based on various usage patterns and customer service interactions.

Problem Statement:
SyriaTel, like many telecommunication providers, faces challenges in retaining customers due to factors such service dissatisfaction, competitive offers,shifting customer needs, and many other factors. Identifying customers who are likely to churn before they actually leave allows the company to take proactive measures such as personalized offers, improved service quality, and better customer engagement. Without a predictive approach, customer retention efforts may be reactive and less effective, leading to revenue losses.

Main Objective:

To develop machine learning models that accurately predicts customer churn in order to help SyriaTel reduce churn rates and improve customer satisfaction.
Specific Objectives:

1. Data Exploration & Cleaning – Understand the dataset structure, handle missing values, and preprocess data for analysis.

2. Feature Engineering & Selection – Identify key factors contributing to churn and optimize input variables for modeling.

3. Model Development – Train and evaluate multiple classification models to determine the best-performing one.
Interpretability & Insights – Analyze the key drivers of churn and provide business recommendations.

  Why Now?

Increased Competition: Telecommunications companies are experiencing higher competition, making customer retention more crucial than ever.

Data Availability: SyriaTel has rich historical customer data that can be leveraged for predictive modeling.

Cost Efficiency: Predicting churn allows for targeted interventions, reducing marketing costs while improving customer loyalty.

Advancements in AI & Machine Learning: Modern machine learning techniques make churn prediction more accurate and actionable than traditional rule-based approaches.

 Metrics of Success:

Accuracy & Precision: Ensuring the model correctly classifies customers into churn and non-churn categories.

Recall (Sensitivity): High recall ensures that most potential churners are identified.

F1-score: Balancing precision and recall to optimize performance.

ROC-AUC Score: Measuring the model’s ability to distinguish between churn and non-churn customers.

Business Impact: Reduction in churn rates and improved customer engagement based on model-driven interventions.

Data Understanding:

The SyriaTel Customer Churn Dataset contains information about customers, their usage patterns, service subscriptions, and interactions with customer service. The dataset is structured with 3,333 records and 21 features, including the target variable (Churn), which indicates whether a customer has left the service or not.

Data Preparation:

This phase involves transforming raw data into a structured and clean format suitable for modeling. This step ensures that the dataset is free from inconsistencies, missing values, and unnecessary variables while preparing it for machine learning algorithms.
